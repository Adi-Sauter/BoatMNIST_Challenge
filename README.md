# BoatMNIST_Challenge

*** Please note that some of the code was already given by the course instructors (see template file). ***  
This repository contains two python-files which correspond to two different convolutional neural networks, **challenge_nn_small.py** and **challenge_nn_big.py**. These neural networks were programmed for the SeaDronesSee-competition in the lecture 'Introduction to Neural Networks' by Prof. Zell. The task was to classify images in the sense that the network had to decide whether there was a boat on water in the image or not. One of the two networks won the competition (see 'Heisenberg' at https://seadronessee.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/leaderboard?competition=Boat-MNIST&primaryMetric=Test%20Accuracy), while the other one would have achieved the 4th place. 
The repository also contains the final report and the instructions/ guideline for the challenge.
